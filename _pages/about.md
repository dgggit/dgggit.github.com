I am a senior student mainly studying computer science in POSTECH. My research/development interest primarily relies on all kinds of big data platforms, including database systems and distributed systems. I believe introducing deep learning into these systems will let them behave much smarter. I'm also interested in data-driven technologies such as knowledge base and deep learning systems that may bring revolutionary business insights.
