<h3>Motivation</h3>

The need for DL visualization is rapidly increasing. The primary reason may be the nature of DL codes, which are in most cases much more complex compared to that of the deep learning model. Consequently, researchers suffer from debugging and tend to waste their time, which works as a very critical bottleneck in DL research pipeline due to its rapidly-changing environment. From my own experience, the dirtiness of the deep learning codes is almost determininistic (especially in the research environment) for the following reasons:

1. Writing mathematic equations in code lines is not intuitive at all. Consider, for example, you have to choose variable name for each component in an equation. It sucks!
2. Models change a lot when doing research, and thus codes get dirty and easily lose is structure. Although the DL model & its code is well-designed, as time flows, it may be altered easily.
3. Many DL researchers are far from writing clean codes.

The ultimate solution in this project is to provide a research-level visual editor for deep learning developers. With this editor, developers may design their model without writing codes, and will further be easily able to debug, save, present, and share their visualized models.

There already exists some of DL model editors, supporting some of the most simple models (mostly early vision models), which is never enough for research-level development.
