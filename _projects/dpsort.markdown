<i>(The project is conducted as a educational-purpose course project : POSTECH CS434 - Advanced Programming)</i>

<h3>Goal</h3>

In this project, the ultimate goal is set to succeed in distributed / parallel sorting of huge K/V records which are stored in multiple machines. For achieving the project, MapReduce approach for distributed sorting is recommended.

Another goal is to learn advanced programming techniques such as following, which are most crucial programming concepts which developers must keep in mind.
- Documentation techniques
- Testing
- Functional programming + OOP (for this purpose, Scala is used)
- Design patterns
- Concurrency control & Parallelism
- Writing clean codes
