<h3>Motivation</h3>

While most of the datasets we can easily encounter are unchanged, these data tend not to be suited well in real-world problems. The major difficulty comes from the continuously changing data, which are called as <strong>stream data</strong>. To effectively handle stream data very difficult in 2 major reasons, that are 1) Analyzing stream data requires a solid and systematic underlying stream processing system, and 2) the inevitable nature of trickiness of time-series data processing.

With these reasons, the opensourced projects barely deal with well-formed, end-to-end stream data processing examples that covers from system-level to data-science level.


<h3>Goal</h3>

In this project, we provide an end-to-end stream data processing example that mimics a real-world situation. The example will mainly be composed of following components, where each components are solid and easy to handle.
- Stream data simulator
- Big data platforms (will be dockerized)
- Analysis platform and data mining techniques

With this toy project, the viewers will easily be able to 1) experience the whole pipeline of stream processing system, and 2) recognize difficulties and barriers in the process of stream processing system development.
